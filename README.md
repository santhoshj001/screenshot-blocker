A comprehensive and production-ready Android library that prevents screenshots and screen recording using Android's `FLAG_SECURE` feature. Built with Kotlin, zero dependencies, and designed for modern Android applications.

## Installation

Add JitPack to your `settings.gradle.kts` (or root `build.gradle.kts`):
```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        // ... other repositories
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```

Then, add the library to your app's `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.santhoshj001:screenshot-blocker:1.3.0")
}
```

## Quick Start

Initialize in your `Application` class to automatically protect all activities:

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        ScreenshotBlocker.init(this) // Enables global screenshot blocking
    }
}
```
